verdictText: "Louis is the rare rival boss who earns the right to lecture you. The fight is mechanically sharp, narratively loaded, and timed at exactly the point in the game where your party composition finally feels like a statement. He doesn't just test your build — he tests whether you've been paying attention to what the game has been saying."

*The music shifts before the cutscene ends. You know what that means. The camera holds on his face for two beats longer than it needs to — and in those two beats, you remember every conversation you've had with him. Every polite disagreement that wasn't polite at all.*

Louis doesn't ambush you. He announces himself. He's been announcing himself for forty hours, in every throne room monologue and quiet aside. By the time the fight begins, you're not surprised — you're overdue.

What makes him linger isn't the spectacle, though there's plenty of that. It's the discomfort of fighting someone whose argument you half-understand. The game has spent dozens of hours letting him be articulate, even persuasive, and the fight doesn't let you forget it.

<div class="bf-prose">

The first phase is almost gentle. Louis mirrors your formation — if you brought healers, he brought denial. If you stacked offense, he has answers for burst. It feels less like a boss fight and more like an argument in combat form. Every time you find an opening, it's because he let you, and you know it.

Phase II is where the rhythm breaks. The careful back-and-forth gives way to something rawer. His patterns become less predictable, his windows tighter. I burned through my reserves here on attempt two, convinced the aggression was a bluff. It wasn't.

<div class="bf-prose">

What Louis gets right — what most rival bosses get wrong — is proportion. The fight's difficulty is calibrated to the weight of the narrative moment. Too easy and the scene deflates; too hard and the story stalls. Louis lands in the narrow band where you feel the resistance without resenting it.

The counterargument is obvious: he's still a JRPG boss, still bound by turn order and exploitable elemental weaknesses. The spectacle has limits. But the game knows this, and compensates by making the fight feel authored rather than systemic. His phase transitions are hand-placed emotional beats, not HP thresholds.

By the time I cleared Phase III on attempt four, the victory felt less like optimisation and more like resolution. I didn't out-level him. I out-committed him. That's the distinction the fight is built around, and it's the reason he stays with you.

<div class="bf-prose">

The screen holds on the aftermath longer than you expect. No victory fanfare, no loot screen. Just the quiet acknowledgment that you understood what he was asking, and answered anyway.

That silence is the real verdict.
