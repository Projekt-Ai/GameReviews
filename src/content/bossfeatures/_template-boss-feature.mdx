{/* ── OPENING PROSE ──────────────────────────
    Start mid-scene, mid-feeling, or mid-thought.
    Don't open with "This boss..." or game summary.
    The hook should place the reader inside your

{/* ── PHASE TRACKER ──────────────────────────
    One row per distinct phase or shift in the fight.
    Keep descriptions observational, not prescriptive.

    Pressure pips: 5 total. Add class "on" for active (red),
    "half" for partial (gold). Remove the phase-intensity
    block entirely if you'd rather not use pips.

    Add or remove phase-row blocks as needed.
