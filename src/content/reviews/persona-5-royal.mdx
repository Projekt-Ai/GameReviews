*[One sentence that captures your angle on the game. Not a description, a take.]*

[Open mid-scene, mid-thought, or mid-feeling. Start with a specific moment instead of explaining what the game is.]

[Pull back and give context. What were you expecting, and what did you bring into it as a player?]

<div class="break">* * *</div>

[Talk about the thing that actually defined your time with the game. The mechanic, mood, or narrative thread you kept thinking about between sessions.]

[Bring in comparisons only if they sharpen your point. Let the review follow your experience rather than a checklist order.]

<blockquote class="pull-quote">
  <p>"[A line that captures your experience in your own voice. First-person is fine.]"</p>
</blockquote>

[Work in technical issues or design complaints where they naturally fit, instead of isolating them into a separate section.]

[Continue with what surprised you, where the game clicked, or where it lost momentum. Focus on how the game felt in practice.]

[A short digression is fine if it clarifies your perspective. Keep it in service of the review.]

[Start winding down by returning to the opening image or feeling. Avoid switching to summary mode too early.]

    [Who is this game for, specifically? Who might bounce off it, and why? Be concrete about player taste, pacing tolerance, and what kind of experience they want.]
